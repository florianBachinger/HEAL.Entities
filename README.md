# Abstract Repository
The `HEAL.Entities.DataAccess.Abstractions` library contains the interfaces and abstract implementations of domain driven data access repositories. The `IReadRepository<TEntity, TKey>` interface shown below defines the minimum methods required for read-only access. The `ICRUDDomainRepository<TEntity, TKey>` interface specializes functionality for create, read, update and delete capabilities. 

```C#
public interface IReadRepository<TEntity, TKey>
    where TEntity : IDomainObject<TKey>
    where TKey : IComparable<TKey> {
  
  IEnumerable<TEntity> GetAll();

  IEnumerable<TEntity> Get( Expression<Func<TEntity, bool>> filter, 
      Func<IQueryable<TEntity>, IOrderedQueryable<TEntity>> orderBy, 
      string includeProperties);
  
  TEntity GetByKey(TKey id);
}
```

This shared abstraction library ensures that repository can switch between e.g. Excel and RDBMS implementation (e.g. a repository `IPersonRepository: IReadRepository<Person,long>`). This allows for example to read data from an Excel source but to store it to a Database simply by switching the implementation at runtime.
This enables clear separation of concerns and easy maintenance of code, though at the higher cost of solution design and initial implementation effort.

# RDBMS Repositories
**Visit [HEAL.Entities.DataAccess.EFCore documentation](docs/HEAL.Entities.DataAccess.EFCore.md) for more details.**

The RDBMS repository project provides domain oriented database access by utilizing the EntityFramework Core library. 

Usage example:
```C#
public class Student : IDomainObject<long?> 
{
  public long? StudentId { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string EMail { get; set; }
}
...
using (var context = new DbContext()) {
  var repo = new CRUDRepository<Student,long>(context);
  var student = new Student(){
    Name = "Xenocrates",
    EMail = "Xenocrates@mail.bc"
  }

  // e.g. BIGINT Identity for student id
  var studentId = repo.Insert(student); 
  ...
  IEnumerable<Person> persons = repo.GetAll();
}
```

This package also provides default repository implementations for the **Data Vault 2.0** schema with Hub, Link, and Satellite tables. Visit [here](docs/HEAL.Entities.DataAccess.EFCore.DWH.DV2.md) for more details.

# Excel Repositories
**Visit [here](docs/HEAL.Entities.DataAccess.EPPlus.md) for more details.**

`HEAL.Entities.DataAccess.EPPlus` allows access to work with line-oriented Excel data sheets through .NET objects and utilizes [EPPlus](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus).

Example for data stored in an Excel sheet:
| Row Nr. | A              | B         |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
|         | **First Name** | **Age**   |
| 1       | Henry          | 23        |
| 2       | Penelope       | 41        |
| 3       | Julia          | 37        |

This table can be read with the following code.
```C#
public class Person : IDomainObject<int>, ITestDomainObject {
  [ExcelAudit(ExcelAuditProperties.RowId)]
  public int PrimaryKey { get; set; }  
  [ExcelColumnConfiguration(ExcelColumnEnum.A)]
  public string Name { get; set; }
  [ExcelColumnConfiguration(ExcelColumnEnum.B)]
  public int Age { get; set; }
}
...
using (var context = new ExcelContext()) {
  // extracts mapping information from the attributes
  context.BuildAttributedEntity<Person>();

  using (var fileOptions = new ExcelFileOptions(new FileStream(@"Data\TestData.xlsx", FileMode.Open)))
  using (var repo = new EPPlusDomainRepository<Person, int>(context, fileOptions)) {
    IEnumerable<Person> data = repo.GetAll();
  }
}
```

The Excel repository supports clean separation of concerns in the POCO by providing a fluent API for property mapping similar to .NET Entity Framework. 

```C#
public class TestExcelContext : ExcelContext {

  public TestExcelContext(ExcelOptions options) : base(options) { }

  protected override void OnCreating(ExcelModelBuilder modelBuilder) {
    modelBuilder.Entity<Person>(Configure_ExcelDomainObjectConfiguration);
  }

  private void Configure_ExcelDomainObjectConfiguration(ExcelEntityBuilder<Person> builder) {
    builder.AuditRowId(x => x.PrimaryKey);

    builder.Property(x => x.Name)
      .Column(ExcelColumnEnum.A)
      .HasHeaderName("First Name");
    ...
  }
}
...      
```

# Domain Objects
`HEAL.Entities.Objects` serves as a base for all domain object oriented libraries of this solution. Domain objects have a unique identification for comparison of objects.

```C#
public interface IDomainObject<T> : IComparable<IDomainObject<T>>
                  where T : IComparable<T>
{
  T PrimaryKey { get; set; }
}     
```
Composite keys for repositories are supported as well.

# Utils Library
HEAL.Entities.Utils contains utility methods used in multiple projects of this solution that are general enough to warrant extraction into a separate project. 

This project is lightweight and introduces no additional external dependencies. 

Functionality includes for example:
- Algorithm for finding data differences between 2D jagged data structures
- reflection helpers for property selectors
- extension methods for `IEnumerable<T>` that provide sorting functionality
